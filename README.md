# ELBaselines
This repo is aimed to create baseline results for Entity Linking, by running a text against the state-of-the-art systems for entity linking, using their most standard configuration.

To run this, use the following command (change python with python3 if your default Python version is 2.x):
```python
python3 run_naf.py GOLD/aida_naf {outputfile}
```

**Note:** This project is experimental and needs some more work.
