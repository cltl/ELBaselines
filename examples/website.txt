I am a PhD researcher at <entity>VU University</entity> in <entity><entity>Amsterdam</entity>, <entity>the Netherlands</entity></entity>. My research project is one of the four <entity>Understanding Language by Machines (ULM)</entity> subprojects, all of which are funded by the <entity>Spinoza prize</entity> and led by <entity>Piek Vossen</entity> (<entity>Dr. Piek Vossen</entity> got awarded the <entity>Spinoza</entity> funding in 2013). <entity>ULM</entity> aims to develop computer models that can assign deeper meaning to language that approximates human understanding and to use these models to automatically read and understand text.
